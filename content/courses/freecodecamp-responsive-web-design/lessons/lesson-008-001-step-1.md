# Step 1

As you've seen in the previous projects, webpages should start with a `DOCTYPE html` declaration, followed by an `html` element.

Add a `DOCTYPE html` declaration at the top of the document, and an `html` element after that. Give the `html` element a `lang` attribute with `en` as its value.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. Your code should contain the `DOCTYPE` reference.
2. You should include a space after the `DOCTYPE` reference.
3. You should define the document type to be `html`.
4. You should close the `DOCTYPE` declaration with a `>` after the type.
5. Your `html` element should have an opening tag with a `lang` attribute of `en`.
6. Your `html` element should have a closing tag.
7. Your `DOCTYPE` declaration should be at the beginning of your HTML.
