# Step 1

For this workshop, you have been provided with a basic boilerplate.

Start this accessibility journey by providing a `lang` attribute to your `html` element. This will assist screen readers in identifying the language of the page.

Also, remember to link your stylesheet to the page.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
--fcc-editable-region--
<html>
  <head>

  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should give the `html` element a `lang` attribute. _Hint: You can use the value `en` for English._
2. You should have a `link` element in your `head` element.
3. Your `link` element should have `rel="stylesheet"` and `href="styles.css"`.
