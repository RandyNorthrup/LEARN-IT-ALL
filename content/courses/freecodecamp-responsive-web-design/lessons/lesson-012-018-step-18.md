# Step 18

Your first building looks pretty good now. Nest three new `div` elements in the `.background-buildings` container and give them the classes of `bb2`, `bb3`, and `bb4` in that order. These will be three more buildings for the background.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">    
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>City Skyline</title>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />   
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="background-buildings">
      <div class="bb1">
        <div class="bb1a"></div>
        <div class="bb1b"></div>
        <div class="bb1c"></div>
        <div class="bb1d"></div>
      </div>
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
