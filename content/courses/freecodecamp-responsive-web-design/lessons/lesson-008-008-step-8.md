# Step 8

Now that your external CSS file is set up, you can start styling the page.

As a reminder, here's how to target a paragraph element and align it to the right:

```css
p {
  text-align: right;
}
```

Create a new CSS rule that targets the `h1` element, and set its `text-align` property to `center`.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Colored Markers</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>CSS Color Markers</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should use an `h1` selector.
2. Your `h1` CSS rule should have a `text-align` property set to `center`.
