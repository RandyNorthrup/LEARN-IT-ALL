# Step 8

The `vh` unit stands for viewport height, and is equal to 1% of the `height` of the viewport. This makes it relative to the viewport height.

It is time to spruce the project up with some CSS. Begin by giving the `body` a `width` of `100%`, and a `height` of `100vh`.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Registration Form</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should use the `body` element selector.
2. You should give the `body` a `width` of `100%`.
3. You should give the `body` a `height` of `100vh`.
