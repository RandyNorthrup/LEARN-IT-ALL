# Step 1

Welcome to the first part of the Accessibility Quiz. As you are becoming a seasoned HTML and CSS developer, we have started you off with the basic boilerplate.

Start this accessibility journey by providing a `lang` attribute to your `html` element. This will assist screen readers in identifying the language of the page.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
--fcc-editable-region--
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should give the `html` element a `lang` attribute. _Hint: You can use the value `en` for English._
