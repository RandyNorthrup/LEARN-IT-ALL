# Step 4

To prepare to create some actual content, add a `body` element below the `head` element.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
--fcc-editable-region--
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
  </head>
--fcc-editable-region--
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should have an opening `<body>` tag.
2. You should have a closing `</body>` tag.
3. You should not change your `head` element. Make sure you did not delete your closing tag.
4. Your `body` element should come after your `head` element.
