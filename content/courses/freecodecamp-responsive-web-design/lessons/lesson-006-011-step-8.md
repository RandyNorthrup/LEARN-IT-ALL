# Step 8

There will be two sections on the menu, one for coffees and one for desserts. Add a `section` element within the `main` element so you have a place to put all the coffees available.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
  </head>
  <body>
--fcc-editable-region--
    <main>
      <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>
      <p>Est. 2020</p>
    </main>
--fcc-editable-region--
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should have an opening `<section>` tag.
2. You should have a closing `</section>` tag.
3. You should not change your existing `main` element. Make sure you didn't delete the closing tag.
4. Your `section` element should be within your `main` element.
