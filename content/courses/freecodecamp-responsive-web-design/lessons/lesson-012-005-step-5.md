# Step 5

In CSS, you can target everything with an asterisk. Add a border to everything by using the `*` selector, and giving it a `border` of `1px solid black`. This is a trick that helps visualize where elements are and their size. You will remove this later.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">    
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>City Skyline</title>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should use the `*` selector.
2. You should use the `border` property to style all the elements.
3. All elements should have a `1px solid black` border.
