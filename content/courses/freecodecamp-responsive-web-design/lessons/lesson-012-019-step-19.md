# Step 19

Give the new buildings `width` and `height` properties of: `10%` and `50%` for `.bb2`, `10%` and `55%` for `.bb3`, and `11%` and `58%` for `.bb4`. You will be using almost all percent based units and some flexbox for this project, so everything will be completely responsive.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">    
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>City Skyline</title>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />   
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="background-buildings">
      <div class="bb1">
        <div class="bb1a"></div>
        <div class="bb1b"></div>
        <div class="bb1c"></div>
        <div class="bb1d"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="bb2"></div>
      <div class="bb3"></div>
      <div class="bb4"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
