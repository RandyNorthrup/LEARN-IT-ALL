# Step 24

While the red and blue markers look the same, the green one is much lighter than it was before. This is because the `green` color keyword is actually a darker shade, and is about halfway between black and the maximum value for green.

In the `.two` CSS rule, set the green value in the `rgb` function to `127` to lower its intensity.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Colored Markers</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>CSS Color Markers</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="marker one">
      </div>
      <div class="marker two">
      </div>
      <div class="marker three">
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. Your `.two` CSS rule should have a `background-color` property set to `rgb(0, 127, 0)`.
