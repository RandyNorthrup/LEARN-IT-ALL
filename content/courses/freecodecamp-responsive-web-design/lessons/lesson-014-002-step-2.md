# Step 2

Below the `DOCTYPE`, add an `html` element with a `lang` attribute set to `en`, so that you have a place to start putting some code.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
<!DOCTYPE html>

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. Your `DOCTYPE` declaration should be at the beginning of your HTML.
2. Your `html` element should have an opening tag, and `lang` attribute with value of `en`.
3. Your `html` element should have a closing tag.
4. Your `html` tags should be in the correct order.
5. You should only have one `html` element.
