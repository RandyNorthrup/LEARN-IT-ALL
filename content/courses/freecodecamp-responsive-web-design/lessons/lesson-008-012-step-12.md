# Step 12

The background color was applied, but since the marker `div` element has no content in it, it doesn't have any height by default.

In your `.marker` CSS rule, set the `height` property to `25px` and the `width` property to `200px`

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Colored Markers</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>CSS Color Markers</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="marker">
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. Your `.marker` CSS rule should have a `width` property set to `200px`.
2. Your `.marker` CSS rule should have a `height` property set to `25px`.
