# Step 5

It's time to add some menu content. Add a `main` element within the existing `body` element. It will eventually contain pricing information about coffee and desserts offered by the cafe.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
  </head>
--fcc-editable-region--
  <body>
  </body>
--fcc-editable-region--
</html>
```

## Hints

1. Your code should have an opening `<main>` tag.
2. Your code should have a closing `</main>` tag.
3. You should not change your `body` element. Make sure you don't accidentally delete your closing tag.
4. Your `main` tag should be within your `body` tag.
