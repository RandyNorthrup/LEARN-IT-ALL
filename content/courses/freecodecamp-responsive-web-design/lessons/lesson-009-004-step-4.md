# Step 4

Add a `header` element within the `body` element and assign a class of `header` to it.

Inside the `header`, create an `h1` with `css flexbox photo gallery` as the text.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head lang="en">
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Photo Gallery</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should have a `header` element within your `body` element.
2. Your `header` element should have a `class` with `header` as the value.
3. Your `header` element should have an `h1` element inside it.
4. Your `h1` element should have the text `css flexbox photo gallery` inside it.
