# Step 7

You can see the `body` (it's the inner-most box on your page); the box around it is the `html` element. Make your `body` fill the whole viewport by giving it a `height` of `100vh`. Remove the default `margin` from the `body` by setting the `margin` to `0`. Finally, set the `overflow` property to `hidden` to hide any scroll bars that appear when something extends past the viewport.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">    
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>City Skyline</title>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should use the `body` selector.
2. Your `body` should have a `height` of `100vh`.
3. Your `body` should have a `margin` of `0`.
4. Your `body` should have the `overflow` property set to `hidden`.
