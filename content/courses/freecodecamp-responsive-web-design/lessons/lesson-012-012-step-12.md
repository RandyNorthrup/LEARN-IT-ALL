# Step 12

Give the parts of your building `width` and `height` properties with these values: `70%` and `10%` to `.bb1a`, `80%` and `10%` to `.bb1b`, `90%` and `10%` to `.bb1c`, and `100%` and `70%` to `.bb1d`. Remember that these percentages are relative to the parent and note that the heights will add up to 100% - vertically filling the container.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">    
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>City Skyline</title>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />   
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="background-buildings">
      <div class="bb1">
        <div class="bb1a"></div>
        <div class="bb1b"></div>
        <div class="bb1c"></div>
        <div class="bb1d"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

2. You should give `.bb1a` a `width` of `70%`.
3. You should give `.bb1a` a `height` of `10%`.
4. You should use a class selector to style `.bb1b`.
5. You should give `.bb1b` a `width` of `80%`.
6. You should give `.bb1b` a `height` of `10%`.
7. You should use a class selector to style `.bb1c`.
8. You should give `.bb1c` a `width` of `90%`.
9. You should give `.bb1c` a `height` of `10%`.
10. You should use a class selector to style `.bb1d`.
