# Step 5

Lastly in the `head`, the `title` element is useful for screen readers to understand the content of a page. Furthermore, it is an important part of _SEO_.

Give your page a `title` that is descriptive and concise.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
--fcc-editable-region--
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta name="description" content="freeCodeCamp Accessibility Quiz practice project" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
--fcc-editable-region--
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should add a `title` element to the `head`.
2. You should not make the `title` longer than 60 characters.
3. Try being more descriptive with your `title` element. _Hint: At least 15 characters_
