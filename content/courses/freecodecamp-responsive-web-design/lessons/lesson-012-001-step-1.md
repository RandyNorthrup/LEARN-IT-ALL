# Step 1

Welcome to the CSS Variables Skyline project! Start by adding the `!DOCTYPE html` declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. Your code should contain the `DOCTYPE` reference.
2. You should include a space after the `DOCTYPE` reference.
3. You should define the document type to be `html`.
4. You should close the `DOCTYPE` declaration with a `>` after the type.
5. Your `DOCTYPE` declaration should be at the beginning of your HTML.
