# Step 39

Notice how your eyes are naturally drawn to the red color in the center? When designing a site, you can use this effect to draw attention to important headings, buttons, or links.

There are several other important color combinations outside of complementary colors, but you'll learn those a bit later.

For now, use the `rgb` function in the `.two` CSS rule to set the `background-color` to black.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Colored Markers</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>CSS Color Markers</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="marker one">
      </div>
      <div class="marker two">
      </div>
      <div class="marker three">
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. Your `.two` CSS rule should have a `background-color` property set to `rgb(0, 0, 0)`.
