# Step 6

Next, give each `img` a `src` attribute according to its order in the document. The first `img` should have a `src` of `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/1.jpg`. The rest should be the same, except replace the `1` with the number the `img` is in the document.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Photo Gallery</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <header class="header">
      <h1>css flexbox photo gallery</h1>
    </header>
--fcc-editable-region--
    <div class="gallery">
      <img>
      <img>
      <img>
      <img>
      <img>
      <img>
      <img>
      <img>
      <img>
    </div>
--fcc-editable-region--
  </body>
</html>
```
