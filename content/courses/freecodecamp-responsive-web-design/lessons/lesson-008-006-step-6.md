# Step 6

Now you're ready to start adding content to the page.

Within the `body`, nest an `h1` element with the text `CSS Color Markers`.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Colored Markers</title>
  </head>
--fcc-editable-region--
  <body>
  </body>
--fcc-editable-region--
</html>
```

## Hints

1. Your code should have an `h1` element.
2. You should have an opening `h1` tag.
3. You should have a closing `h1` tag.
4. Your `h1` element should be within the `body` element.
5. Your `h1` element should have the text `CSS Color Markers`.
6. Remember, the casing and spelling matter for the `h1` text.
