# Step 2

The `h1` through `h6` heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so `h2` elements have less importance than `h1` elements. 

```html
<h1>most important heading element</h1>
<h2>second most important heading element</h2>
<h3>third most important heading element</h3>
<h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
<h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
<h6>least important heading element</h6>
```

Only use one `h1` element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

Below the `h1` element, add an `h2` element with this text:

`Cat Photos`

## Starter Code

```html
<html>
  <body>
--fcc-editable-region--
    <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
    
--fcc-editable-region--
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. Your `h1` element should have an opening tag. Opening tags have this syntax: `<elementName>`.
2. Your `h1` element should have a closing tag. Closing tags have a `/` just after the `<` character.
3. You should only have one `h1` element. Remove the extra.
4. Your `h1` element's text should be `CatPhotoApp`. You have either omitted the text or have a typo.
5. Your `h2` tags should be in lowercase. By convention, all HTML tags are written in lowercase.
6. Your `h2` element should have an opening tag. Opening tags have this syntax: `<elementName>`.
7. Your `h2` element should have a closing tag. Closing tags have a `/` just after the `<` character.
8. Your `h2` element's text should be `Cat Photos`. Only place the text `Cat Photos` between the opening and closing `h2` tags.
9. Your `h2` element should be below the `h1` element. The `h1` element has greater importance and must be above the `h2` element.
