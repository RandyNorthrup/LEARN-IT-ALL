# Step 1

Begin with your standard HTML boilerplate. Add a `DOCTYPE` declaration, an `html` element specifying this page is in English, a `head` element, and a `body` element.

Add a `<meta>` tag with the appropriate `charset` and a `<meta>` tag for mobile responsiveness within the `head` element.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. Your code should contain the `DOCTYPE` reference.
2. You should include a space after the `DOCTYPE` reference.
3. You should define the document type to be `html`.
4. You should close the `DOCTYPE` declaration with a `>` after the type.
5. You should have an opening `<html>` tag, and it should have `lang` of `en`.
6. Your `html` element should have a closing tag.
7. Your `DOCTYPE` declaration should be at the beginning of your HTML.
8. You should have an opening `<head>` tag.
9. You should have a closing `</head>` tag.
10. You should have an opening `<body>` tag.
11. You should have a closing `</body>` tag.
12. The `head` and `body` elements should be siblings.
13. The `head` element should be within the `html` element.
14. The `body` element should be within the `html` element.
15. You should have two `meta` elements.
16. One `meta` element should have a `name` set to `viewport`, and `content` set to `width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0`.
17. The other `meta` element should have the `charset` attribute set to `UTF-8`.
