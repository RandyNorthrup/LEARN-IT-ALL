# Step 2

Add opening and closing `html` tags below the `DOCTYPE` so you have a place to start putting some code. Be sure to set the language to English.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. Your `DOCTYPE` declaration should be at the beginning of your HTML.
2. Your `html` element should have an opening tag, and `lang` attribute with value of `en`.
3. Your `html` element should have a closing tag.
4. Your `html` tags should be in the correct order.
5. You should only have one `html` element.
