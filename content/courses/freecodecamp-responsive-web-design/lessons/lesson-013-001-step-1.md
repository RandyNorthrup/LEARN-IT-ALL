# Step 1

HTML elements have opening tags like `<h1>` and closing tags like `</h1>`. The text an element will display goes between its opening and closing tags.

Change the text of the `h1` element below from `Hello World` to `CatPhotoApp` and watch the change in the browser preview.

When you are done, press the "Check Your Code" button to see if it's correct.

## Starter Code

```html
<html>
  <body>
--fcc-editable-region--
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
--fcc-editable-region--
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. The text `CatPhotoApp` should be present in the code. You may want to check your spelling.
2. Your `h1` element should have an opening tag. Opening tags have this syntax: `<elementName>`.
3. Your `h1` tags should be in lowercase. By convention, all HTML tags are written in lowercase.
4. Your `h1` element should have a closing tag. Closing tags have a `/` just after the `<` character.
5. You have more than one `h1` element. Remove the extra `h1` element.
6. Your `h1` element's text should be `CatPhotoApp`. You have either omitted the text, have a typo, or it is not between the `h1` element's opening and closing tags.
