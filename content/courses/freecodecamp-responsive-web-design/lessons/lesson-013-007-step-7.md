# Step 7

You can add images to your website by using the `img` element. `img` elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. An element without a closing tag is known as a <dfn>void element</dfn>.

Add an `img` element below the `p` element. At this point, no image will show up in the browser.

## Starter Code

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
      <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
--fcc-editable-region--
      <p>Everyone loves cute cats online!</p>
      
--fcc-editable-region--
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. Your `img` element should have an opening tag. Opening tags have this syntax: `<elementName>`.
2. Your `img` element should not have a closing tag `</img>`.
3. You should only have one `img` element. Remove any extras.
4. Your `img` element should be below the `p` element. You have them in the wrong order.
