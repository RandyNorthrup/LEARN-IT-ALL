# Step 35

Now that you've gone through all the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors on a color wheel, it'll be easier to understand other color theory concepts and how they impact design.

First, in the CSS rules `.one`, `.two`, and `.three`, adjust the values in the `rgb` function so that the `background-color` of each element is set to pure black. Remember that the `rgb` function uses the additive color model, where colors start as black and change as the values of red, green, and blue increase.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Colored Markers</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>CSS Color Markers</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="marker one">
      </div>
      <div class="marker two">
      </div>
      <div class="marker three">
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. Your `.one` CSS rule should have a `background-color` property set to `rgb(0, 0, 0)`.
2. Your `.two` CSS rule should have a `background-color` property set to `rgb(0, 0, 0)`.
3. Your `.three` CSS rule should have a `background-color` property set to `rgb(0, 0, 0)`.
