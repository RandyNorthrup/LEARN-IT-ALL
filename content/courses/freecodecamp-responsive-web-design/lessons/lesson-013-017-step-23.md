# Step 23

The `li` element is used to create a list item in an ordered or unordered list.

Here is an example of list items in an unordered list:

```html
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
```

Within the `ul` element nest three list items to display three things cats love:

`catnip`

`laser pointers`

`lasagna`

## Starter Code

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
        <p>Everyone loves <a href="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg">cute cats</a> online!</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Cat Lists</h2>

        <ul>

      </section>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should have three `li` elements. Each `li` element should have its own opening and closing tag.
2. You should have three `li` elements with the text `catnip`, `laser pointers` and `lasagna` in any order. You have either omitted some text or have a typo.
3. The three `li` elements should be located between the `ul` element's opening and closing tags.
