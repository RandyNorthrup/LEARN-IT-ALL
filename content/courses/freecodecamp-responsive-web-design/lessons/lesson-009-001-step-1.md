# Step 1

Begin with your standard HTML boilerplate. Add a `DOCTYPE` declaration, an `html` element, a `head` element, and a `body` element.

Add the `lang` attribute to the opening `<html>` tag with `en` set as the value.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

2. You should include a space after the `DOCTYPE` reference.
3. You should define `html` as the document type.
4. You should close the `DOCTYPE` declaration with a `>` after the type.
5. Your `html` element should have an opening tag.
6. Your `html` element should have a closing tag.
7. Your opening `<html>` tag should have the `lang` attribute with `en` as the value.
8. Your `DOCTYPE` declaration should be at the beginning of your HTML.
9. You should have an opening `head` tag.
10. You should have a closing `head` tag.
11. You should have an opening `body` tag.
12. You should have a closing `body` tag.
13. The `head` and `body` elements should be siblings.
