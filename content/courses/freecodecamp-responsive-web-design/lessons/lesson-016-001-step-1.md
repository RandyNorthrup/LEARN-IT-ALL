# Step 1

Begin with the basic HTML structure. Add a `DOCTYPE` declaration and `html`, `head`, `body`, and `title` elements.

Set the language of this page to English. Set the `title` to `Piano`.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. Your code should contain the `DOCTYPE` reference.
2. You should include a space after the `DOCTYPE` reference.
3. You should define the document type to be `html`.
4. You should close the `DOCTYPE` declaration with a `>` after the type.
5. Your `html` element should have an opening tag with a `lang` attribute of `en`.
6. Your `html` element should have a closing tag.
7. Your `DOCTYPE` declaration should be at the beginning of your HTML.
8. You should have an opening `head` tag.
9. You should have a closing `head` tag.
10. You should have an opening `body` tag.
11. You should have a closing `body` tag.
12. The `head` and `body` elements should be siblings.
13. The `head` element should be within the `html` element.
14. The `body` element should be within the `html` element.
15. Your code should have a `title` element.
16. Your project should have a title of `Piano`.
17. Remember, the casing and spelling matter for the title.
