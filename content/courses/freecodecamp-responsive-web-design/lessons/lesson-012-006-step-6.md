# Step 6

Also add a `box-sizing` of `border-box` to everything. This will make it so the border you added doesn't add any size to your elements.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">    
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>City Skyline</title>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should use the `box-sizing` property.
2. You should make use of the existing `*` selector.
3. All elements should have a `box-sizing` of `border-box`.
