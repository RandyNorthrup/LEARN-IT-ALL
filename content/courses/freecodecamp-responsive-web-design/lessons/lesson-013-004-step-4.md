# Step 4

Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with `<!--`, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with `-->`. 

Here is an example of a comment with the `TODO: Remove h1`:

```html
<!-- TODO: Remove h1 -->
```

Add a comment above the `p` element with this text:

`TODO: Add link to cat photos`

## Starter Code

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
    <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
--fcc-editable-region--
    
    <p>Everyone loves cute cats online!</p>
    
--fcc-editable-region--
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. Your comment should start with `<!--`. You are missing one or more of the characters that define the start of a comment.
2. Your comment should end with `-->`.  You are missing one or more of the characters that define the end of a comment.
3. Your code should not have extra opening/closing comment characters. You have an extra `<!--` or `-->` displaying in the browser.
4. Your comment should be above the `p` element. You have them in the wrong order.
5. Your comment should contain the text `TODO: Add link to cat photos`.
