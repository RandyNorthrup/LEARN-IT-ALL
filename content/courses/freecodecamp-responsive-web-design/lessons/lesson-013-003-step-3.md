# Step 3

The `p` element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites. Create a `p` element below your `h2` element and give it the following text:

`Everyone loves cute cats online!`

## Starter Code

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
--fcc-editable-region--
    <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
    
--fcc-editable-region--
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. Your `p` element should have an opening tag. Opening tags have the following syntax: `<elementName>`.
2. Your `p` tags should be in lowercase. By convention, all HTML tags are written in lowercase.
3. Your `p` element should have a closing tag. Closing tags have a `/` just after the `<` character.
4. Your `p` element's text should be `Everyone loves cute cats online!` You have either omitted the text or have a typo.
5. Your `p` element should be below the `h2` element. You have them in the wrong order.
