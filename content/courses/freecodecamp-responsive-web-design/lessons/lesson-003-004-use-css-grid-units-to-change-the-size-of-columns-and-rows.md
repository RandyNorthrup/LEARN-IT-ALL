# Use CSS Grid units to Change the Size of Columns and Rows

You can use absolute and relative units like `px` and `em` in CSS Grid to define the size of rows and columns. You can use these as well:

`fr`: sets the column or row to a fraction of the available space,

`auto`: sets the column or row to the width or height of its content automatically,

`%`: adjusts the column or row to the percent width of its container.

Here's the code that generates the output in the preview:

```css
grid-template-columns: auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr;
```

This snippet creates five columns. The first column is as wide as its content, the second column is 50px, the third column is 10% of its container, and for the last two columns; the remaining space is divided into three sections, two are allocated for the fourth column, and one for the fifth.

## Instructions

Make a grid with three columns whose widths are as follows: 1fr, 100px, and 2fr.

## Starter Code

```html
<style>
  .d1 {
    background: LightSkyBlue;
  }
  .d2 {
    background: LightSalmon;
  }
  .d3 {
    background: PaleTurquoise;
  }
  .d4 {
    background: LightPink;
  }
  .d5 {
    background: PaleGreen;
  }

  .container {
    font-size: 40px;
    width: 100%;
    background: LightGray;
    display: grid;
    /* Only change code below this line */

    grid-template-columns: auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr;

    /* Only change code above this line */
    grid-template-rows: 50px 50px;
  }
</style>

<div class="container">
  <div class="d1">1</div>
  <div class="d2">2</div>
  <div class="d3">3</div>
  <div class="d4">4</div>
  <div class="d5">5</div>
</div>
```

## Hints

1. Your `container` class should have a `grid-template-columns` property that has three columns with the following widths: `1fr`, `100px`, and `2fr`.

## Solution

```html
```html
<style>
  .container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 100px 2fr;
  }
</style>
```
```
