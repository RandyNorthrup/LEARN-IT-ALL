# Step 7

In order to better visualize how your elements are sized, adding a border can be helpful.

Give your `.gallery` element a `width` of `50%` and a `border` set to `5px solid red`.

Then give your `img` elements a `width` of `100%`, `padding` set to `5px`, and a `border` set to `5px solid blue`.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Photo Gallery</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <header class="header">
      <h1>css flexbox photo gallery</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/1.jpg">
