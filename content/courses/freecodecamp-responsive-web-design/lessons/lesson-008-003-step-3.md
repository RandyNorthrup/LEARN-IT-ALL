# Step 3

Remember that the `title` element gives search engines extra information about the page. It also displays the content of that `title` element in two more ways:

* in the title bar when the page is open  
* in the browser tab for the page when you hover on it. Even if that tab is not active, once you hover on the tab, the `title` text is displayed.

Within the `head` element, nest a `title` element with the text `Colored Markers`.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
--fcc-editable-region--
  <head>
  </head>
--fcc-editable-region--
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should have an opening `title` tag.
2. You should have a closing `title` tag.
3. Your project should have the title `Colored Markers`.
4. Remember, casing and spelling matter for the title text.
