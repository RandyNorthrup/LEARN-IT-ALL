# Step 1

You will be building a happy Flappy Penguin, and further exploring CSS transforms and animations in the process.

Begin with your basic HTML boilerplate. Include the `DOCTYPE` declaration, `html` element with a language set to English, the appropriate `meta` tags, a `head`, `body`, and `title` element. Also, link your stylesheet to the page.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. Your code should have a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
2. Your code should have an `html` element.
3. Your `html` element should have an opening tag with a `lang` attribute of `en`.
4. Your `html` element should have a closing tag.
5. Your code should have a `head` element within the `html` element.
6. Your code should have a `body` element within the `html` element.
7. Your `head` element should come before your `body` element.
8. You should have two `meta` elements.
9. One `meta` element should have a `name` set to `viewport`, and `content` set to `width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0`.
10. The other `meta` element should have the `charset` attribute set to `UTF-8`.
11. Your code should have a `title` element.
12. Your `title` should have some text.
13. Your code should have a `link` element.
14. Your `link` element should be within your `head` element.
15. Your `link` element should have a `rel` attribute with the value `stylesheet`.
16. Your `link` element should have an `href` attribute with the value `styles.css`.
