# Step 7

To let visitors know the cafe was founded in 2020, add a `p` element below the `h1` element with the text `Est. 2020`.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
--fcc-editable-region--
      <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>
--fcc-editable-region--
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should have an opening `<p>` tag.
2. You should have a closing `</p>` tag.
3. You should not change your existing `h1` element. Make sure you did not delete the closing tag.
4. Your `p` element should be below your `h1` element.
5. Your `p` element should have the text `Est. 2020`.
