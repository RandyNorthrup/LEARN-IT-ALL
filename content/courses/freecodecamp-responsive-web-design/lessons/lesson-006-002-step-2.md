# Step 2

Add a `head` element within the `html` element, so you can add a `title` element. The `title` element's text should be `Cafe Menu`.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should have an opening `<head>` tag.
2. You should have a closing `</head>` tag.
3. You should have an opening `<title>` tag.
4. You should have a closing `</title>` tag.
5. Your `title` element should be nested in your `head` element.
6. Your `title` element should have the text `Cafe Menu`. You may need to check your spelling.
