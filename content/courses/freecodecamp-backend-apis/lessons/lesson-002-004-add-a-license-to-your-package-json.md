# Add a License to Your package.json

The `license` field is where you inform users of what they are allowed to do with your project.

Some common licenses for open source projects include MIT and BSD. License information is not required, and copyright laws in most countries will give you ownership of what you create by default. However, it’s always a good practice to explicitly state what users can and can’t do. Here's an example of the license field:

```json
"license": "MIT",
```

## Instructions

Fill the `license` field in the package.json file of your project as you find suitable.

## Hints

1. package.json should have a valid "license" key
