# Use model.find() to Search Your Database

In its simplest usage, `Model.find()` accepts a query document (a JSON object) as the first argument, then a callback. It returns an array of matches. It supports an extremely wide range of search options. Read more in the docs.

## Instructions

Modify the `findPeopleByName` function to find all the people having a given name, using <code>Model.find() -\> [Person]</code>

Use the function argument `personName` as the search key.

## Hints

1. Find all items corresponding to a criteria should succeed
