# Chain Search Query Helpers to Narrow Search Results

If you don’t pass the callback as the last argument to `Model.find()` (or to the other search methods), the query is not executed. You can store the query in a variable for later use. This kind of object enables you to build up a query using chaining syntax. The actual db search is executed when you finally chain the method `.exec()`. You always need to pass your callback to this last method. There are many query helpers, here we'll use the most commonly used.

## Instructions

Modify the `queryChain` function to find people who like the food specified by the variable named `foodToSearch`. Sort them by `name`, limit the results to two documents, and hide their age. Chain `.find()`, `.sort()`, `.limit()`, `.select()`, and then `.exec()`. Pass the `done(err, data)` callback to `exec()`.

## Hints

1. Chaining query helpers should succeed
