# Add Keywords to Your package.json

The `keywords` field is where you can describe your project using related keywords. Here's an example:

```json
"keywords": [ "descriptive", "related", "words" ],
```

As you can see, this field is structured as an array of double-quoted strings.

## Instructions

Add an array of suitable strings to the `keywords` field in the package.json file of your project.

One of the keywords should be "freecodecamp".

## Hints

1. package.json should have a valid "keywords" key
2. "keywords" field should be an Array
3. "keywords" should include "freecodecamp"
