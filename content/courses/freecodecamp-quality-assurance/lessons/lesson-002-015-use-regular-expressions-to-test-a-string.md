# Use Regular Expressions to Test a String

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project cloned from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub</a>.

`match()` asserts that the actual value matches the second argument regular expression.

## Instructions

Within `tests/1_unit-tests.js` under the test labeled `#15` in the `Strings` suite, change each `assert` to either `assert.match` or `assert.notMatch` to make the test pass (should evaluate to `true`). Do not alter the arguments passed to the asserts.

## Hints

1. All tests should pass.
2. You should choose the correct method for the first assertion - `match` vs. `notMatch`.
3. You should choose the correct method for the second assertion - `match` vs. `notMatch`.
