# Learn How JavaScript Assertions Work

Working on these challenges will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

- Clone <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">this GitHub repo</a> and complete these challenges locally.
- Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

## Instructions

Within `tests/1_unit-tests.js` under the test labeled `#1` in the `Basic Assertions` suite, change each `assert` to either `assert.isNull` or `assert.isNotNull` to make the test pass (should evaluate to `true`). Do not alter the arguments passed to the asserts.

## Hints

1. All tests should pass.
2. You should choose the correct method for the first assertion - `isNull` vs. `isNotNull`.
3. You should choose the correct method for the second assertion - `isNull` vs. `isNotNull`.
