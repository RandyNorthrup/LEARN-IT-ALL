# Compare the Properties of Two Elements

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project cloned from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub</a>.

## Instructions

Within `tests/1_unit-tests.js` under the test labeled `#8` in the `Comparisons` suite, change each `assert` to either `assert.isAbove` or `assert.isAtMost` to make the test pass (should evaluate to `true`). Do not alter the arguments passed to the asserts.

## Hints

1. All tests should pass.
2. You should choose the correct method for the first assertion - `isAbove` vs. `isAtMost`.
3. You should choose the correct method for the second assertion - `isAbove` vs. `isAtMost`.
4. You should choose the correct method for the third assertion - `isAbove` vs. `isAtMost`.
5. You should choose the correct method for the fourth assertion - `isAbove` vs. `isAtMost`.
