# Use the Double Equals to Assert Equality

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project cloned from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub</a>.

`equal()` compares objects using `==`.

## Instructions

Within `tests/1_unit-tests.js` under the test labeled `#5` in the `Equality` suite, change each `assert` to either `assert.equal` or `assert.notEqual` to make the test pass (should evaluate to `true`). Do not alter the arguments passed to the asserts.

## Hints

1. All tests should pass.
2. You should choose the correct method for the first assertion - `equal` vs. `notEqual`.
3. You should choose the correct method for the second assertion - `equal` vs. `notEqual`.
4. You should choose the correct method for the third assertion - `equal` vs. `notEqual`.
5. You should choose the correct method for the fourth assertion - `equal` vs. `notEqual`.
