# Test if One Value is Below or At Least as Large as Another

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project cloned from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub</a>.

## Instructions

Within `tests/1_unit-tests.js` under the test labelled `#9` in the `Comparisons` suite, change each `assert` to either `assert.isBelow` or `assert.isAtLeast` to make the test pass (should evaluate to `true`). Do not alter the arguments passed to the asserts.

## Hints

1. All tests should pass.
2. You should choose the correct method for the first assertion - `isBelow` vs. `isAtLeast`.
3. You should choose the correct method for the second assertion - `isBelow` vs. `isAtLeast`.
4. You should choose the correct method for the third assertion - `isBelow` vs. `isAtLeast`.
5. You should choose the correct method for the fourth assertion - `isBelow` vs. `isAtLeast`.
