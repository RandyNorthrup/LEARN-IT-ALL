# Use the Triple Equals to Assert Strict Equality

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project cloned from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub</a>.

`strictEqual()` compares objects using `===`.

## Instructions

Within `tests/1_unit-tests.js` under the test labeled `#6` in the `Equality` suite, change each `assert` to either `assert.strictEqual` or `assert.notStrictEqual` to make the test pass (should evaluate to `true`). Do not alter the arguments passed to the asserts.

## Hints

1. All tests should pass.
2. You should choose the correct method for the first assertion - `strictEqual` vs. `notStrictEqual`.
3. You should choose the correct method for the second assertion - `strictEqual` vs. `notStrictEqual`.
4. You should choose the correct method for the third assertion - `strictEqual` vs. `notStrictEqual`.
5. You should choose the correct method for the fourth assertion - `strictEqual` vs. `notStrictEqual`.
