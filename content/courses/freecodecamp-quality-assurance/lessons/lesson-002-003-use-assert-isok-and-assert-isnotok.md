# Use Assert.isOK and Assert.isNotOK

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project cloned from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub</a>.

`isOk()` will test for a truthy value, and `isNotOk()` will test for a falsy value.

To learn more about truthy and falsy values, try our <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/falsy-bouncer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Falsy Bouncer</a> challenge.

## Instructions

Within `tests/1_unit-tests.js` under the test labeled `#3` in the `Basic Assertions` suite, change each `assert` to either `assert.isOk()` or `assert.isNotOk()` to make the test pass (should evaluate to `true`). Do not alter the arguments passed to the asserts.

## Hints

1. All tests should pass.
2. You should choose the correct method for the first assertion - `isOk` vs. `isNotOk`.
3. You should choose the correct method for the second assertion - `isOk` vs. `isNotOk`.
4. You should choose the correct method for the third assertion - `isOk` vs. `isNotOk`.
