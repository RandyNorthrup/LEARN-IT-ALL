# Test if a String Contains a Substring

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project cloned from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub</a>.

`include()` and `notInclude()` work for strings too! `include()` asserts that the actual string contains the expected substring.

## Instructions

Within `tests/1_unit-tests.js` under the test labeled `#14` in the `Strings` suite, change each `assert` to either `assert.include` or `assert.notInclude` to make the test pass (should evaluate to `true`). Do not alter the arguments passed to the asserts.

## Hints

1. All tests should pass.
2. You should choose the correct method for the first assertion - `include` vs. `notInclude`.
3. You should choose the correct method for the second assertion - `include` vs. `notInclude`.
