# Test if a Value is a String

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project cloned from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub</a>.

`isString` or `isNotString` asserts that the actual value is a string.

## Instructions

Within `tests/1_unit-tests.js` under the test labeled `#13` in the `Strings` suite, change each `assert` to either `assert.isString` or `assert.isNotString` to make the test pass (should evaluate to `true`). Do not alter the arguments passed to the asserts.

## Hints

1. All tests should pass.
2. You should choose the correct method for the first assertion - `isString` vs. `isNotString`.
3. You should choose the correct method for the second assertion - `isString` vs. `isNotString`.
4. You should choose the correct method for the third assertion - `isString` vs. `isNotString`.
