# Solving Systems of Equations: Extra

This video will show you one way to create a calculator that solves and graphs. It will also show you how to zoom in or zoom out on the graph and write the code to build that feature.

Here is the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a_RtRtVfeO0m2528T4V-bCXozWf3HpM7?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Colab notebook used in this video.</a> This will give you an example of what your notebook could look like so far, as you have some functions in there and create headings for the next few functions.
