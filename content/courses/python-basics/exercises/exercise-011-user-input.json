  "starterCode": "# Create an interactive calculator that:\n# 1. Asks for the user's name\n# 2. Asks for two numbers\n# 3. Calculates and displays the sum, difference, and product\n\n# Task 1: Get user's name and store in 'name' variable\n# (For testing purposes, use name = \"Alice\")\nname = \"Alice\"\n\n# Task 2: Get first number and convert to float, store in 'num1'\n# (For testing purposes, use num1 = 10.0)\nnum1 = 10.0\n\n# Task 3: Get second number and convert to float, store in 'num2'\n# (For testing purposes, use num2 = 5.0)\nnum2 = 5.0\n\n# Task 4: Calculate sum and store in 'sum_result'\n\n\n# Task 5: Calculate difference (num1 - num2) and store in 'difference'\n\n\n# Task 6: Calculate product and store in 'product'\n\n\n# Task 7: Create a formatted message:\n# \"Hello, [name]! The sum is [sum_result], difference is [difference], and product is [product].\"\n# Store in 'message' variable\n\n",
