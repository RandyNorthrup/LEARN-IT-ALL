  "description": "Refactor code with poor variable names to follow Python naming conventions.\n\nThe code works but violates naming conventions:\n- Single letter variables (x, y, z)\n- Unclear abbreviations\n- Wrong case (camelCase instead of snake_case)\n- No descriptive names\n\nRefactor all variable names to be clear and follow PEP 8.\n\nThe program calculates a student's final grade.",
