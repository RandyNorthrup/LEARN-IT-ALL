      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) uses short labels instead of IP addresses for forwarding, enabling traffic engineering, QoS, and VPNs. Labels are added at ingress, swapped at transit routers, and removed at egress. MPLS operates between Layer 2 and Layer 3. Common in enterprise WANs but being supplemented by SD-WAN.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) encapsulates PPP frames for transmission over IP networks. L2TP itself doesn't provide encryption, so it's typically combined with IPsec (L2TP/IPsec). Uses UDP port 1701. Supports multiple protocols. PPTP is legacy and insecure. IPsec operates at Layer 3.",

      "explanation": "Transport mode encrypts only the payload, preserving the original IP header. Used for host-to-host communication. Tunnel mode encapsulates and encrypts the entire packet (including original IP header) in a new IP packet. Tunnel mode is used for site-to-site VPNs and provides better security by hiding internal addresses.",

      "explanation": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G (24-100 GHz) provides multi-gigabit speeds but has very short range (few hundred meters) and poor building penetration. Mid-band balances speed and coverage. Low-band provides wide coverage but slower speeds. Carriers deploy all three for comprehensive coverage.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "SD-WAN (Software-Defined WAN) uses multiple transport types (MPLS, Internet, LTE, 5G) with centralized cloud-based management and application-aware routing. Benefits: cost savings, better performance, simplified management, automatic failover. Replaces expensive MPLS-only WANs. Uses overlay networks.

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Application-aware routing identifies applications (DPI) and routes based on requirements and link conditions. VoIP uses low-latency link, bulk data uses cheapest link. Monitors link quality (latency, jitter, packet loss) and steers traffic dynamically. This optimization is SD-WAN's key advantage over traditional static routing.",

      "explanation": "SD-WAN continuously monitors all links (latency, jitter, packet loss, availability) and automatically fails over to backup link when primary degrades or fails. Sub-second failover. Can use multiple links simultaneously (active/active). Traditional routing requires manual intervention or slow convergence. Critical for business continuity.",
