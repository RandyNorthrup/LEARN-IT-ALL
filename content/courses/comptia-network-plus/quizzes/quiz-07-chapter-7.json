      "question": "Which cloud service model provides users with virtual machines they manage while the provider manages the physical infrastructure?",
      "options": [
        "SaaS (Software as a Service)",
        "PaaS (Platform as a Service)",
        "IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)",
        "DaaS (Desktop as a Service)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) provides virtual machines, storage, and networking that customers manage. The provider manages physical hardware. Examples: AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine. PaaS provides application platforms. SaaS provides complete applications. IaaS offers most control but requires most management.",

        "Resource overcommitment",
        "High availability",
        "Live migration"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Resource overcommitment (memory overcommitment, CPU oversubscription) allows hypervisors to assign more resources than physically available by sharing among VMs. Not all VMs use maximum resources simultaneously. This increases density but risks performance degradation if overused. Memory ballooning and transparent page sharing enable this.",

        "Migrate VM to another host",
        "Assign more resources"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Snapshots capture the complete state of a VM (disk, memory, configuration) at a point in time. Used for backups before changes or for testing. Can quickly revert to snapshot if issues occur. However, snapshots consume storage and can impact performance. Not a replacement for proper backups. Multiple snapshots create chains.",

        "Containers require more resources than VMs",
        "VMs are portable but containers are not"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Containers share the host OS kernel and run as isolated processes, making them lightweight and fast. VMs have separate OS instances with dedicated kernels. Containers start in seconds vs minutes for VMs. Containers use less resources but provide less isolation. Docker and Kubernetes manage containers. VMs better for running different OS types.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Hot aisle/cold aisle separates hot exhaust air from cold intake air, improving cooling efficiency by up to 40%. Racks face each other alternately: cold aisles have rack fronts (intake), hot aisles have rack backs (exhaust). Containment systems fully enclose aisles. This prevents hot and cold air mixing, reducing cooling costs significantly.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "In spine-leaf architecture, every leaf switch connects to every spine switch in a full mesh, but spines don't connect to each other and neither do leaves. This creates equal-cost paths and predictable latency (maximum 2 hops: leaf-spine-leaf). No spanning tree needed. Scales horizontally.

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hybrid cloud combines private infrastructure (on-premises or private cloud) with public cloud, providing flexibility to keep sensitive data on-premises while bursting to public cloud for scalability. Use case: run stable workloads on-premises, burst to cloud for peak demand. Requires integration and orchestration. More complex than single cloud but offers best of both worlds.",

      "explanation": "Vertical scaling (scale up) adds more CPU/RAM to existing server. Limited by hardware maximums and requires downtime. Horizontal scaling (scale out) adds more servers. Infinitely scalable, provides redundancy, no downtime. Cloud applications should be designed for horizontal scaling. Stateless applications scale horizontally easily.
