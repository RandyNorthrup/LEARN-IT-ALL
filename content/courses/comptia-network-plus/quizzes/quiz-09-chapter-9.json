      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Signal strength (RSSI) alone doesn't indicate quality. SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) is more important. Strong signal with high noise = poor performance. Check: interference sources (microwave, Bluetooth), co-channel interference, channel utilization. Use wireless analyzer. SNR >25 dB good for data, >40 dB excellent. Interference degrades SNR.",
