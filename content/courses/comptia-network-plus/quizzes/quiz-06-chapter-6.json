      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "802.11n (Wi-Fi 4) was the first standard to support both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies and introduced MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology. It can achieve up to 600 Mbps. 802.11g only supports 2.4 GHz, while 802.11ac is 5 GHz only. 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) came later.",

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) has a maximum theoretical speed of 9.6 Gbps across multiple streams using advanced modulation (1024-QAM) and OFDMA. Real-world speeds are typically much lower. 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) maxes at 6.9 Gbps, and 802.11n at 600 Mbps.",

      "explanation": "In the 2.4 GHz band, only channels 1, 6, and 11 do NOT overlap in North America (channels 1-11 available). Each 2.4 GHz channel is 20 MHz wide but spaced only 5 MHz apart, causing overlap. Using non-overlapping channels prevents co-channel interference in adjacent access points.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The 5 GHz band has significantly more non-overlapping channels (up to 24 in some regions) compared to only 3 in 2.4 GHz. However, 5 GHz has shorter range and worse penetration through obstacles. 2.4 GHz travels farther and penetrates better but has more interference from microwave ovens, Bluetooth, and other devices.",

      "explanation": "OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) in Wi-Fi 6 allows multiple devices to transmit simultaneously by dividing channels into smaller resource units. MU-MIMO allows simultaneous transmission to multiple devices but not from them. OFDMA significantly improves efficiency in dense environments with many devices.",

      "explanation": "WPA2 uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with CCMP (Counter Mode with CBC-MAC Protocol) for strong encryption. WEP used weak RC4, and WPA used TKIP (also RC4-based but with improvements). AES is a symmetric block cipher considered secure and is required for high-security networks.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "WPA2-Personal uses a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) that all users share. WPA2-Enterprise uses 802.1X authentication with individual credentials validated against a RADIUS server, providing per-user authentication, accountability, and easier credential management. Both use AES encryption.",

      "explanation": "RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is the standard for enterprise wireless authentication with 802.1X.

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol - Transport Layer Security) requires certificates on both client and server for mutual authentication, making it the most secure EAP method. PEAP uses server certificates only. EAP-TLS is complex to deploy due to certificate management but provides strongest security.",

      "explanation": "PEAP creates an encrypted TLS tunnel using a server certificate, then transmits credentials (typically MSCHAPv2 or GTC) securely through the tunnel. This protects credentials from eavesdropping. PEAP is easier to deploy than EAP-TLS since only the server needs a certificate, not every client.",

This dramatically reduces congestion. 802.11be is Wi-Fi 7 (future). The 6 GHz band is less congested since it's new.",

      "explanation": "A rogue access point is an unauthorized AP connected to your network, often installed by employees for convenience without IT approval. Rogue APs bypass network security controls and can allow unauthorized access. Wireless intrusion detection systems (WIDS) scan for rogue APs. An evil twin is a rogue AP impersonating a legitimate one.",

      "explanation": "An evil twin attack involves creating a fake AP with the same SSID as a legitimate network, often with stronger signal to lure clients. When clients connect, the attacker can intercept traffic or steal credentials. Evil twins are difficult for users to detect without comparing MAC addresses or using certificate-based authentication.",

      "explanation": "WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) using PIN method has a critical flaw that allows brute-force attacks in hours. The 8-digit PIN is validated in two 4-digit halves, reducing possible combinations dramatically. WPS should be disabled on all APs. PBC (Push Button Configuration) WPS is less vulnerable but still not recommended for enterprise networks.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Disabling SSID broadcast (hidden SSID) provides minimal security through obscurity - the network name is still easily discovered using packet capture tools since SSIDs are sent in other management frames. It's NOT a security control but may reduce casual visibility. Hidden SSIDs can actually cause connectivity issues and are not recommended as a primary security measure.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Centralized (tunneled) architecture routes all AP data traffic through the wireless controller using CAPWAP or similar tunneling protocols. This allows centralized policy enforcement and visibility but creates a potential bottleneck. Distributed architecture has APs forward data locally. Autonomous APs operate independently without a controller.",

      "explanation": "Channel bonding combines adjacent channels to increase bandwidth. 802.11n supports 40 MHz channels (2 x 20 MHz), 802.11ac supports up to 160 MHz (8 x 20 MHz). Wider channels provide higher speeds but reduce available channels and increase interference. Channel bonding is more practical in 5 GHz due to more available channels.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Co-channel interference occurs when multiple APs on the same or overlapping channels interfere with each other, reducing performance. This is common in dense deployments. Solution: use non-overlapping channels (1, 6, 11 in 2.4 GHz), reduce AP power, or use 5 GHz which has more channels. Adjacent-channel interference occurs on nearby but not overlapping channels.",

General guidelines: >40 dB (excellent), 25-40 dB (good for VoIP/video), 15-25 dB (adequate for basic data), <15 dB (poor). SNR measures signal quality relative to background noise.

Materials affect attenuation differently: air (minimal), drywall (low), brick/concrete (medium), metal/water (high). Free-space path loss increases with distance and frequency. 5 GHz attenuates more than 2.4 GHz, resulting in shorter range.",
