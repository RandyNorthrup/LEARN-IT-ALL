      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "When a switch receives a frame with an unknown destination MAC (not in CAM table), it FLOODS the frame out all ports in the same VLAN except the port it arrived on. This ensures the frame reaches the destination even if the switch hasn't learned its location yet. When the destination replies, the switch learns that MAC address.

Store-and-forward reads entire frame and checks FCS (highest latency but error-free). Fragment-free reads first 64 bytes (compromise, catches collision fragments).

Frames belonging to the native VLAN traverse the trunk without tags. CRITICAL: Native VLAN must MATCH on both ends of the trunk or you get VLAN mismatch errors.

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "EtherChannel/Link Aggregation combines multiple physical links into one logical link with load balancing. With 4 x 1 Gbps links, you get 4 Gbps aggregate bandwidth (all links active simultaneously). Load balancing uses hash algorithms (src-mac, dst-mac, src-dst-ip, etc.) to distribute flows across links. Individual flows don't exceed single link speed (1 Gbps per flow), but aggregate throughput is sum of all links.

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "STP's primary purpose is to PREVENT LAYER 2 LOOPS in networks with redundant paths. Without STP, loops cause broadcast storms, MAC table instability, and duplicate frames, crashing the network in seconds. STP elects one root bridge, calculates best path to root, and BLOCKS redundant paths. When active path fails, STP unblocks backup path (failover). STP doesn't use all paths (that would create loops)—it blocks some for loop prevention while maintaining redundancy for failover.",

GLBP AVG (Active Virtual Gateway) answers ARPs with different virtual MACs (up to 4), distributing clients across AVFs (Active Virtual Forwarders). Load balancing methods: round-robin, weighted, host-dependent. HSRP and VRRP only have one active forwarder (others standby). GLBP provides both redundancy AND bandwidth utilization.

Pre-computed and stored in topology table, installed IMMEDIATELY if Successor (best route) fails—no query process needed (fast convergence). Feasibility condition ensures loop-free backup. EIGRP can have multiple Feasible Successors. If Successor fails and no Feasible Successor exists, EIGRP sends queries (slower convergence).

'show vlan' shows same info but more verbose. 'show interfaces trunk' shows trunk ports and allowed VLANs (not access ports). 'show spanning-tree vlan X' shows STP information for specific VLAN. For quick overview of VLAN assignments, 'show vlan brief' is go-to command. Essential for VLAN verification and troubleshooting.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Native VLAN mismatch causes traffic for mismatched VLANs to CROSS VLANS (serious security risk). Example: Native VLAN 1 on Switch A, Native VLAN 99 on Switch B—untagged frames from VLAN 1 interpreted as VLAN 99 on other side. CDP generates 'native VLAN mismatch' warnings. VTP domain/mode mismatches also generate warnings. Best practice: Verify native VLAN matches with 'show interfaces trunk'. Change native VLAN from default 1 to unused VLAN for security. Configuration: 'switchport trunk native vlan 99'.",

      "explanation": "DR (Designated Router) on multi-access networks (Ethernet) reduces OSPF adjacencies from full mesh (n(n-1)/2) to hub-spoke (n-1). All routers form adjacency with DR (and BDR backup). DR collects LSAs from all routers and redistributes—reduces LSA flooding. Without DR on 10-router segment: 45 adjacencies needed. With DR: 9 adjacencies. DR election: highest priority (default 1), tiebreaker highest Router ID. BDR (Backup DR) takes over if DR fails. Point-to-point links don't need DR/BDR.
