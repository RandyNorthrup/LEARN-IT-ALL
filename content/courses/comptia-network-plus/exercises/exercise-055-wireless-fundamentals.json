clients: 1 simultaneous  \n- Total: ~5 devices per transmission cycle\n- Transmission cycles needed: 60 / 5 = 12 cycles\n- Cycle time: ~10-20 ms each\n- Total service time: 120-240 ms per round\n- Effective throughput: 1300 Mbps / 60 devices = 21.7 Mbps per device\n\n**802.11ax Performance with OFDMA + MU-MIMO:**\n- OFDMA allocations: 8-12 devices per 80 MHz channel\n- MU-MIMO spatial streams: 8 simultaneous\n- Effective multiplexing: 8-12 devices per transmission\n- Transmission cycles needed: 60 / 10 = 6 cycles\n- Cycle time: ~5-10 ms each\n- Total service time: 30-60 ms per round\n- Effective throughput: 4800 Mbps / 60 devices = 80 Mbps per device\n- Improvement: 3.7x higher throughput, 75% latency reduction\n\n**Network Impact:**\n- Building A: Conference room clients now have sufficient bandwidth for HD video, large file uploads\n- Building B: Multiple engineers uploading CAD files simultaneously without throttling\n- Building C: VoIP phones and web browsing no longer

(single WiFi network)\n- Coloring: Assign unique identifier to distinguish between nearby networks\n- Problem addressed: Hidden Node Problem in dense deployments\n\n**The Hidden Node Problem (Pre-WiFi 6):**\n\n**Scenario: Your campus with 4 buildings + 2 neighboring buildings**\n- Building A AP broadcasts on Channel 6 (2.4 GHz)\n- Neighboring Building 1 AP also on Channel 6 (outside your control)\n- Devices see both signals\n- Problem: Device receiving from Neighboring AP doesn't know to avoid Building A channel\n- Result: Collisions, retransmissions, throughput loss\n\n**802.11ac Solution Limitation:**\n- CCA (Clear Channel Assessment): Check if channel busy before transmitting\n- Effectiveness: 60-70% improvement, but still detects other network's traffic\n- Inefficiency: Defer transmission even when there's no collision risk\n\n**802.11ax BSS Coloring Solution:**\n- Each network assigned color (0-63, 6-bit field)\n- Building A: Color 1\n- Building B: Color 2\n- Neighboring Building 1: Color 3\n- Neighboring Building 2: Color 4\n\n**BSS Coloring Operation:**\n- Device receives frame with color ID in MAC header\n- Logic: IF color ≠ our color THEN background traffic, don't defer\n- Effect: Only defer for same-BSS frames (actual collisions)\n- Efficiency: Transmit opportunities increase by 30-40%\n\n**NetConnect Multi-Building Implementation:**\n\n**Building A (Main): Color 1**\n- 8 APs all configured Color 1\n- Devices know Color 1 = Building A, defer appropriately\n- Neighboring Building 1 (Color 3): Device ignores their traffic, transmits when Building A channel free\n\n**Building B (Engineering): Color 2**\n- 4 APs configured Color 2\n- 80m outdoor bridge to Building A\n- Own color prevents mistaking Building A traffic as self-interference\n\n**Building C (Call Center): Color 3** (if available)\n**Building D (Warehouse): Color 4** (if available)\n\n**Throughput Impact:**\n- 802.11ac colocated with neighboring AP: ~70 Mbps effective (interference)\n- 802.11ax with BSS Coloring: ~110 Mbps effective (30-40% improvement)\n- Campus-wide benefit: More efficient spectrum sharing with neighbors\n\n**QUESTION 4d: Target Wake Time (TWT) Power Savings Calculation**\n\n**TWT Overview:**\n- Wake Time: Schedule when device wakes up to communicate with AP\n- Reduces: Constant monitoring/listening for traffic\n- Benefit: Dramatic battery life extension\n\n**Current Device Behavior (Pre-WiFi 6):**\n- Device must listen every 1 ms for potential traffic\n- Wakeup cycle: \"Am I sleeping?\", listen for TBTT (Target Beacon Transmission Time)\n- Power state: Device can't enter deep sleep\n- Power consumption: Approximately 50-100 mW baseline (always listening)\n\n**TWT Optimization:**\n\n**Example: Office Laptop with Typical Usage**\n- Usage: 8 hours connected, minimal background traffic\n- Current baseline power (listening): 75 mW\n- With TWT: Device wakes every 100 ms (vs 1 ms)\n- New listening cycles: 8 hours × 3600 s × 10 wakes/second = 288,000 wakeups\n- vs. Current: 8 hours × 3600 s × 1000 wakes/second = 28,800,000 wakeups\n\n**Power Consumption Calculation:**\n\n**Current (No TWT):**\n- Listening power: 75 mW baseline × 8 hours = 600 mWh (example battery = 5000 mWh)\n- Usage time without TWT: 5000 mWh / 600 mWh = 8.3 hours\n- Device dies during business day\n\n**With TWT (100 ms wake interval):**\n- Average listening power: 75 mW × (1ms/100ms) = 0.75 mW listening\n- Sleep power: 5 mW (device deep sleep)\n- Average total: ~5-7 mW\n- Usage time with TWT: 5000 mWh / 35 mWh (average) = 142 hours\n- Real-world impact: 18+ hour battery life\n\n**TWT Wake Schedules by Device Type:**\n\n**High-Priority Devices (VoIP Phone):**\n- Wake interval: 20 ms\n- Requirement: Low latency for incoming calls\n- Power savings: 50% vs baseline\n\n**Standard Devices (Laptop):**\n- Wake interval: 100 ms\n- Requirement: Balance between response time and power\n- Power savings: 95% vs baseline\n\n**Low-Priority Devices (Background sync):**\n- Wake interval: 1000 ms (1 second)\n- Requirement: Eventual consistency acceptable\n- Power savings: 99% vs baseline\n\n**NetConnect Building C (VoIP) Implementation:**\n- 120 VoIP phones with TWT\n- Current: Each phone 75 mW listening = 9 W total\n- With TWT (20 ms schedule): 9 W × 0.05 = 0.45 W total\n- Charger requirement: ~50 chargers vs current 30 in use\n- Net benefit: Devices charge faster, users always have charged devices\n- Battery replacement cycle: Extends 2-3x (less charge cycling)\n\n**NetConnect Building A (Laptops):**\n- 250 laptops, each with 5000 mWh battery\n- Current: 8-10 hour battery (8 hours WiFi + other systems)\n- With TWT: 15-18 hour battery\n- User benefit: Full business day plus evening work possible\n- Productivity: Users don't search for chargers\n- TCO: Fewer battery replacements over 3-5 years",
