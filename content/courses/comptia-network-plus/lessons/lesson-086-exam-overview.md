## Question Types

### Multiple Choice (Single Answer)

**Format**: Question stem followed by 4 answer choices (A, B, C, D).

**Instructions**: "Select the BEST answer."

**Example**:
```
Which of the following protocols operates at Layer 4 of the OSI model and 
provides reliable, connection-oriented communication?

A. IP
B. TCP
C. UDP
D. ICMP

Correct Answer: B (TCP)
```

**Tips**:
- Read question carefully (note qualifiers: BEST, MOST, LEAST)
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers
- If unsure, make educated guess (no penalty for wrong answers)

### Multiple Select (Multiple Answers)

**Format**: Question stem followed by multiple answer choices.

**Instructions**: "Select TWO" (or THREE, etc.).

**Example**:
```
Which of the following are characteristics of IPv6? (Select TWO)

A. Uses 32-bit addresses
B. Uses 128-bit addresses
C. Supports up to 4.3 billion addresses
D. Uses hexadecimal notation
E. Uses dotted decimal notation

Correct Answers: B and D
```

**Tips**:
- Question explicitly states how many to select
- Must select exact number specified
- Selecting too few or too many = incorrect

### Performance-Based Questions (PBQs)

**Format**: Interactive simulations requiring hands-on tasks.

**Examples**:
- **Drag-and-drop**: Match protocols to layers, place devices on network diagram
- **Configuration**: Configure switch ports, create VLANs, set up ACLs
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify misconfiguration in network diagram
- **Command-line**: Type appropriate commands to diagnose issue

**Typical PBQ Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Network Diagram Labeling**:
- Given: Network topology diagram with unlabeled devices
- Task: Drag and drop correct device types (router, switch, firewall, etc.) to appropriate locations

**Scenario 2: VLAN Configuration**:
- Given: Switch with ports that need VLAN assignments
- Task: Configure access ports for specific VLANs, configure trunk ports

**Scenario 3: ACL Configuration**:
- Given: Requirements for traffic filtering
- Task: Create appropriate ACL entries to allow/deny specified traffic

**Scenario 4: IP Configuration Troubleshooting**:
- Given: Network with connectivity issues
- Task: Identify incorrect IP configurations (wrong subnet, incorrect gateway, etc.)

**Scenario 5: Cable Selection**:
- Given: Different networking scenarios and distance requirements
- Task: Select appropriate cable types (Cat6, fiber SMF/MMF, etc.)

**PBQ Tips**:
- **Appear at beginning of exam** (first 3-6 questions typically)
- **Can skip and return**: Flag PBQs, answer multiple choice first if time-constrained
- **Use all available time**: PBQs are complex, worth more points
- **No partial credit**: Must complete correctly
- **Read instructions carefully**: Understand what's being asked
- **Use provided tools**: Many PBQs include built-in tools (ping, traceroute, etc.)

### Drag-and-Drop Questions

**Format**: Match items from one list to another.

**Example**:
```
Match each protocol to its primary function:

Protocols:          Functions:
[DHCP]              [ ] Secure file transfer
[DNS]               [ ] Hostname to IP resolution
[SFTP]              [ ] Automatic IP address assignment
[SNMP]              [ ] Network device monitoring

Task: Drag protocols to matching functions
```

**Tips**:
- Can usually drag items multiple times if needed
- Some may allow many-to-one or one-to-many matching
- Read instructions to understand relationship

## Time Management Strategy

### Time Allocation

**Total Time**: 90 minutes for ~90 questions

**Average Time per Question**: ~1 minute

**Recommended Allocation**:

**PBQs (Performance-Based Questions)**:
- **Time**: 20-30 minutes total
- **Strategy**: Skip initially, complete at end
- **Reason**: Time-intensive, complex
- **Alternative**: If comfortable with PBQs, complete first

**Multiple Choice Questions**:
- **Time**: 60-70 minutes
- **Strategy**: 
  - Quick questions (<30 seconds): Answer immediately
  - Medium questions (30-60 seconds): Answer and move on
  - Difficult questions (>60 seconds): Flag and skip, return later

**Review Time**:
- **Time**: 5-10 minutes
- **Strategy**: Review flagged questions, double-check PBQs

### Pacing Strategy

**First Pass (50 minutes)**:
- Skip all PBQs (flag them)
- Answer all easy/medium multiple choice questions
- Flag difficult multiple choice questions for review
- Goal: Complete ~60 questions

**Second Pass (25 minutes)**:
- Return to flagged multiple choice questions
- Spend more time analyzing difficult questions
- Make educated guesses on questions still unclear
- Goal: Answer all remaining multiple choice

**Third Pass (15 minutes)**:
- Complete all PBQs
- Allocate 3-5 minutes per PBQ
- If running out of time, make best effort on PBQs

### Red Flags: Time Traps

**Avoid**:
- Spending >2 minutes on single multiple choice question
- Re-reading same question repeatedly (diminishing returns)
- Second-guessing previously answered questions excessively
- Starting PBQs without time buffer

**Do**:
- Trust first instinct (statistically more accurate)
- Flag and move on if stuck
- Watch time remaining (displayed on screen)
- Leave 15 minutes minimum for PBQs

## Scoring and Results

### Score Scale

**Score Range**: 100-900

**Passing Score**: 720

**Interpretation**:
- Score is **scaled**, not a raw percentage
- Scaled scoring accounts for exam difficulty variations
- Different exam versions may have slightly different difficulty
- Your score is comparable across all N10-008 exam versions

### Score Calculation

**What You See**:
```
Exam Result: PASS
Score: 758 / 900
Passing Score: 720

Domain Breakdown:
Domain 1 (Networking Fundamentals): 85%
Domain 2 (Network Implementations): 72%
Domain 3 (Network Operations): 78%
Domain 4 (Network Security): 80%
Domain 5 (Network Troubleshooting): 75%
```

**What This Means**:
- Overall scaled score: 758 (passing)
- Domain percentages show relative performance
- Identify weak areas for continued learning
- **No domain-specific minimum required**

### Immediate Results

**At Test Center**:
- Results displayed on screen immediately after exam

- How many points short of passing (e.g., 40 points short)
- Domain-level performance (identify weak areas)

**Retake Policy**:
- **First two attempts**: No waiting period (can retake immediately, but must pay exam fee again)
- **Third attempt**: Must wait 14 days after second failed attempt
- **Fourth+ attempts**: Must wait 14 days between each attempt

**Recommendations After Failing**:
1. Review score report domain breakdown
2. Identify weakest domains (< 70%)
