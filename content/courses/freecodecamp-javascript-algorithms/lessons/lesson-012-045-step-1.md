# Step 1

So far, you have already met different data types:

- Immutable data types, such as integers, strings, tuples, and Booleans.
- Mutable data types, such as lists, and dictionaries.

A dictionary is identified by a pair of curly braces, `{}`.

Start by creating a variable called `copper` and assign it an empty dictionary using a pair of curly braces, in the same way you would create an empty list with a pair of square brackets.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should have a variable called `copper`.
2. Your `copper` variable should have the value of an empty dictionary. Use a pair of curly braces for that.
