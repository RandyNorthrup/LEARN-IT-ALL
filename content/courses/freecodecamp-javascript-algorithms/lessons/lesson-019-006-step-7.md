# Step 7

Now log your `character` variable to the console again. You should see the string `"Hello"`, then the string `"World"`, in the console.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
character = "World";

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should use `console.log` a second time.
2. You should log `character` to the console a second time.
3. Your new `console.log()` should come after your reassignment.
