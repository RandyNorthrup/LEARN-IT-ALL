# Step 1

In this project, you'll learn data structures by building the merge sort algorithm. 

This is a sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer principle to sort collections of data. That is, it 'divides' a collection into smaller sub-parts, and 'conquers' the sub-parts by sorting them independently, then merges the sorted sub-parts.

Create a function called `merge_sort`. This function will handle the task of sorting a list of numbers. 

Use the `pass` keyword in the function body.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should declare a function named `merge_sort`. Don't forget use the `pass` keyword in the function body.
