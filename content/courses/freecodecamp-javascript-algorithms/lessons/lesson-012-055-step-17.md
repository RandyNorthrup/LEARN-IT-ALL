# Step 17

Replace the `'age'` key with the string `'B'` and set its value to the string `'A'` to represent the connection between the nodes in both directions.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
my_graph = {
    'A': 'B',
    'age': 2
}
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. Your dictionary should have a `'B'` key.
2. Your `'B'` key should have `'A'` as the value.
3. Your dictionary should have an `'A'` key.
4. Your `'A'` key should have `'B'` as the value.
5. Your dictionary should have two keys.
