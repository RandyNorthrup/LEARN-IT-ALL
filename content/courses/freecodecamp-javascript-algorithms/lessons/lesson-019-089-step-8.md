# Step 8

When variable names are more than one word, there are specific naming conventions for how you capitalize the words. In JavaScript, the convention to use is <dfn>camel case</dfn>.

Camel case means that the first word in the name is entirely lowercase, but the following words are all title-cased. Here are some examples of camel case:

```js
let variableOne;
let secondVariable;
let yetAnotherVariable;
let thisIsAnAbsurdlyLongName;
```

Use camel case to declare a new `secondCharacter` variable.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
character = "World";
console.log(character);

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should declare a `secondCharacter` variable.
2. You should use `let` to declare your `secondCharacter` variable.
3. You should not assign a value to your `secondCharacter` variable. Do not forget your semicolon.
