# Step 3

Keys must be unique within a dictionary and they can be only immutable data types. This means you cannot use a list or another dictionary as keys.

Add another key `'age'` to your dictionary and give it the integer number `2` as value.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
copper = {'species': 'guinea pig'}
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should have an `'age'` key with the value `2` just after `'species': 'guinea pig'`, inside your `copper` dictionary. Don't forget the comma.
2. You should have two key-value pairs in your `copper` dictionary.
