# Step 20

You can access the values inside an array using the <dfn>index</dfn> of the value. An index is a number representing the position of the value in the array, starting from `0` for the first value.

You can access the value using <dfn>bracket notation</dfn>, such as `array[0]`.

Use `console.log` and bracket notation to print the first value in your `rows` array.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should have a `console.log()` statement in your code.
2. You should access your `rows` array.
3. You should use bracket notation with your `rows` array.
4. You should use bracket notation to access the first element of your `rows` array.
5. You should log the first element of your `rows` array.
