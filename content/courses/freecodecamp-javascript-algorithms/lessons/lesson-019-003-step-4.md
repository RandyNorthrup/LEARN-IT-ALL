# Step 4

JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with String being one of them. In JavaScript, a <dfn>string</dfn> represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.

Note that strings are <dfn>immutable</dfn>, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed. The variable can still be reassigned another value.

Change your `"Hello"` string to use single quotes.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
let character = "Hello";
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should not have double quotes in your code.
2. You should use single quotes for your `"Hello"` string.
3. You should still use `let` in your code.
4. You should still declare a `character` variable.
5. Your `character` variable should still have the string `"Hello"` for its value.
