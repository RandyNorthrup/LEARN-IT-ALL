Now that you have reviewed declaration and initialization, remove the code you wrote for your review.

Do not remove your `character` variable.

## Starter Code

```html
let character = "Hello";
--fcc-editable-region--
let profession = "teacher";
let age;
console.log(age);
console.log(profession);
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should not have a `profession` variable.
2. You should not have a `age` variable.
3. You should not have a `console.log` statement for `age`.
4. You should not have a `console.log` statement for `profession`.
5. You should still have your `character` variable.
