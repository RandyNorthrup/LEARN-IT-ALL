# Step 52

The other bug is subtle. When a shorter distance is found for a neighbor node, `paths[current]` gets assigned to the neighbor node path, `paths[node]`. 

This means both variables point to the same list. Since lists are mutable, when you append the neighbor node to its path, both `paths[node]` and `paths[current]` are modified because they are the same list. This results in wrong paths, although the distances are correct.

You can fix that bug by assigning a copy of `paths[current]` to the neighbor node path. For that you can use the slice syntax:

```py
my_list[:]
```

Where `my_list` is the list you want to copy. Modify the existing `paths[node] = paths[current]` assignment inside your `if` block by slicing `paths[current]`.

## Starter Code

```html
my_graph = {
    'A': [('B', 3), ('D', 1)],
    'B': [('A', 3), ('C', 4)],
    'C': [('B', 4), ('D', 7)],
    'D': [('A', 1), ('C', 7)]
}

def shortest_path(graph, start):
    unvisited = list(graph)
    distances = {node: 0 if node == start else float('inf') for node in graph}
    paths = {node: [] for node in graph}
    paths[start].append(start)
    
    while unvisited:
        current = min(unvisited, key=distances.get)
        for node, distance in graph[current]:
            if distance + distances[current] < distances[node]:
                distances[node] = distance + distances[current]
--fcc-editable-region--                
                if paths[node] and paths[node][-1] == node:
                    paths[node] = paths[current]
--fcc-editable-region--                    
                else:
                    paths[node].extend(paths[current])
                paths[node].append(node)
        unvisited.remove(current)
    
    print(f'Unvisited: {unvisited}\nDistances: {distances}\nPaths: {paths}')
    
shortest_path(my_graph, 'A')
```

## Hints

1. You should assign `paths[current][:]` to the neighbor node path.
