# Step 32

You are now ready to start building your pyramid generator. Your `character` variable will serve as the building block for the pyramid.

`"Hello"` might not work very well for that. Change the value of `character` to be the hash character `"#"`.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
const character = "Hello";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. Your `character` variable should be a hash symbol.
