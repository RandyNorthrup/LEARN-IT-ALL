# Step 1

In this workshop, you will implement the shortest path algorithm. You will write a Python function that computes the shortest path between the nodes in a graph, and also returns the path taken.

For example, given a graph where cities are connected by roads with different distances, the algorithm will find the shortest route from one city to another. If you want to travel from City A to City D, the algorithm might find that going A ⇨ B ⇨ C ⇨ D (total: 15km) is shorter than going directly A ⇨ D (20km).

To get started, define a variable named `INF` and assign it the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. Later, you'll use it to indicate an infinite distance between two nodes.

## Starter Code

```html

```

## Hints

1. You should define the variable `INF` at the top of your file.
2. You should assign `float('inf')` to the variable `INF`.
