# Step 39

Unfortunately, now you cannot see what your loop is doing.

Use `let` to declare a `result` variable, and assign it an empty string. An empty string is represented by quotation marks with nothing between them, such as `""`.

## Starter Code

```html
const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(i);
}

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should declare a `result` variable.
2. You should use `let` to declare your `result` variable.
3. Your `result` variable should be an empty string.
