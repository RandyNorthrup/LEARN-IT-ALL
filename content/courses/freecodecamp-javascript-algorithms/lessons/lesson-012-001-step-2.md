# Step 2

Dictionaries store data in the form of *key*-*value* pairs. A key is separated from the correspondent value by a colon. And each key-value pair is separated from the following pair by a comma:

```py
my_dict = {
    'name': 'Michael',
    'occupation': 'Lumberjack'
}
```

Add a new key-value pair to your dictionary. Use the string `'species'` as the key, and the string `'guinea pig'` as the value.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
copper = {}
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should have a `'species'` key with the value `'guinea pig'` inside your `copper` dictionary.
2. Your `copper` dictionary should have a single key-value pair.
