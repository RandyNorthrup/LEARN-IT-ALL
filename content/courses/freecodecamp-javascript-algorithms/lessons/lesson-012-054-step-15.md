# Step 15

Graphs are data structures representing relations between pairs of elements.
These elements, called *nodes*, can be real-life objects, entities, points in space or others. The connections between the nodes are called the *edges*.

Here's a visual representation of a graph:

<img alt="a weighted graph with 6 nodes" src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/python/graph1-example.png" style="background-color: white; height: 350px; width: auto; padding: 10px; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">


Rename the `copper` dictionary into `my_graph`. This will represent the graph to test your algorithm.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
copper = {
    'species': 'guinea pig',
    'age': 2
}
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should rename your `copper` dictionary into `my_graph`.
2. Your `my_graph` variable should be a dictionary.
