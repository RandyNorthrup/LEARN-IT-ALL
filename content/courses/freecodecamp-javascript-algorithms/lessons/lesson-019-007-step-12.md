# Step 12

You are now ready to declare your next variable. Remove both `console.log` statements, and the `character` reassignment.

Also remove your `secondCharacter` variable, but leave the `character` initialization unchanged.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
character = "World";
let secondCharacter;
secondCharacter = character;
console.log(secondCharacter);
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should not have any `console.log()` statements in your code.
2. You should not reassign the value of `character`.
3. Your `character` variable should have the value `"Hello"`.
4. You should not have a `secondCharacter` variable.
