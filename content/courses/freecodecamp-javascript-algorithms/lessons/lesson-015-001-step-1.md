# Step 1

JavaScript is a powerful language which allows you to build websites that are interactive. 

*Note*: For all remaining projects in this curriculum, you will need a basic level of knowledge in HTML and CSS. If you are new to HTML and CSS, please go through the [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/).

To get started, create your standard HTML boilerplate with a `DOCTYPE`, `html`, `head`, and `body`, then add a `meta` tag for the `charset`. Add a `title` element and use the text `RPG - Dragon Repeller` for it. Include a `link` tag for your stylesheet to link the `styles.css` file.

Finally, create a `div` element with `id` set to `game` within your `body`.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. Your code should contain the `DOCTYPE` reference.
2. You should include a space after the `DOCTYPE` reference.
3. You should define the document type to be `html`.
4. You should close the `DOCTYPE` declaration with a `>` after the type.
5. Your `html` element should have an opening tag. Don't forget the `lang` attribute.
6. Your `html` element should have a closing tag.
7. Your `DOCTYPE` declaration should be at the beginning of your HTML.
8. You should have an opening `head` tag.
9. You should have a closing `head` tag.
10. You should have an opening `body` tag.
11. You should have a closing `body` tag.
12. The `head` and `body` elements should be siblings.
13. The `head` element should be within the `html` element.
14. The `body` element should be within the `html` element.
15. Your code should have a `meta` element.
16. Your `meta` element should have a `charset` attribute with the value `UTF-8`.
17. Your code should have a `title` element.
18. You should have a closing `title` tag.
19. Your code should have a `link` element.
20. You should have a `div` element.
21. Your `div` element should have an `id` attribute with the value `game`.
22. Your `div` element should be within the `body` element.
