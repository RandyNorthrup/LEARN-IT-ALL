# Step 11

In your role playing game, users will be able to track their stats, buy weapons, and fight monsters. Before you can continue with the interactive JavaScript portion of the game, you need to first create the HTML elements that will display the game information.

Create four `div` elements within your `#game` element. Give them the following respective `id` values, in order: `stats`, `controls`, `monsterStats`, and `text`.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
    <title>RPG - Dragon Repeller</title>
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
  </head>
--fcc-editable-region--
  <body>
    <div id="game">
    </div>
  </body>
--fcc-editable-region--
</html>
```
