# Step 6

Remove your `console.log("Hello World");` line to begin writing your project code.

In the previous project, you learned how to work with variables and the `let` keyword like this:

```js
let camperbot;
```

You also learned how to initialize a variable with a value like this:

```js
let age = 32;
```

Use the `let` keyword to declare a variable called `xp` and assign it the value of `0`, a number.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
    <title>RPG - Dragon Repeller</title>
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="game">
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should not have a `console.log("Hello World");` line in your code.
2. You should use the `let` keyword to declare your variable.
3. You should declare a variable named `xp`.
4. `xp` should have a value of `0`.
5. You should initialize the `xp` variable to `0`.
