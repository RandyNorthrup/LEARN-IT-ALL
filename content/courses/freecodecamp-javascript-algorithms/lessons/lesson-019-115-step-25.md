# Step 25

Now you are ready to move onto the next set of array lessons.

Remove all of your code from the previous step.

## Starter Code

```html
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
--fcc-editable-region--
let cities = ["London", "New York", "Mumbai"];
console.log(cities);
cities[cities.length - 1] = "Mexico City";
console.log(cities);
--fcc-editable-region--
console.log(rows);
```

## Hints

1. You should remove all references to your `cities` variable.
