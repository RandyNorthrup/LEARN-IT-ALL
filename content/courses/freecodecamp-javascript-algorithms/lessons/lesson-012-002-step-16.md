# Step 16

For example, a graph can be used to represent two points in the space, `A` and `B`, connected by a path. A graph like this will be made of two nodes connected by an edge.

Replace the existent `'species'` key with the strings `'A'`. Then, replace the correspondent value with the string `'B'` to represent the connection between the `'A'` and `'B'` nodes.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
my_graph = {
    'species': 'guinea pig',
    'age': 2
}
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. Your dictionary should have an `'A'` key.
2. Your `'A'` key should have `'B'` as the value.
3. Your dictionary should have two keys.
