# Make Code More Reusable with the this Keyword

The last challenge introduced a method to the `duck` object. It used `duck.name` dot notation to access the value for the `name` property within the return statement:

```js
sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + duck.name + ".";}
```

While this is a valid way to access the object's property, there is a pitfall here. If the variable name changes, any code referencing the original name would need to be updated as well. In a short object definition, it isn't a problem, but if an object has many references to its properties there is a greater chance for error.

A way to avoid these issues is with the `this` keyword:

```js
let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2,
  sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + this.name + ".";}
};
```

`this` is a deep topic, and the above example is only one way to use it. In the current context, `this` refers to the object that the method is associated with: `duck`. If the object's name is changed to `mallard`, it is not necessary to find all the references to `duck` in the code. It makes the code reusable and easier to read.

## Instructions

Modify the `dog.sayLegs` method to remove any references to `dog`. Use the `duck` example for guidance.

## Starter Code

```html
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + dog.numLegs + " legs.";}
};

dog.sayLegs();
```

## Hints

1. `dog.sayLegs()` should return the given string.
2. Your code should use the `this` keyword to access the `numLegs` property of `dog`.

## Solution

```html
```js
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs () {
    return 'This dog has ' + this.numLegs + ' legs.';
  }
};

dog.sayLegs();
```
```
