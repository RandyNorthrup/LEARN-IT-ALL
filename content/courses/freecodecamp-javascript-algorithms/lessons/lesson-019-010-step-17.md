# Step 17

You can also perform subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`). Feel free to experiment with the operators and numbers in your `console.log`. When you are ready to move on, remove the `console.log`.

## Starter Code

```html
let character = 'Hello';
--fcc-editable-region--
let count = 8;
console.log(count + 1);
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should not have a `console.log()` in your code.
2. Your `character` variable should still have the value `"Hello"`.
3. Your `count` variable should still have the value `8`.
