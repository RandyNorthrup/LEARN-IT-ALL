# Step 33

To generate a pyramid, you will need to create multiple rows. When you have to perform a task repeatedly until a condition is met, you will use a <dfn>loop</dfn>. There are many ways to write a loop.

You are going to start with a basic `for` loop. `for` loops use the following syntax:

```js
for (iterator; condition; iteration) {
  logic;
}
```

In the upcoming steps, you'll explore each component of a loop in detail. For now, construct a `for` loop that includes the terms `"iterator"`, `"condition"`, and `"iteration"` for the three components. Keep the loop <dfn>body</dfn>, the section within the curly braces `{}`, empty.

## Starter Code

```html
const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

```

## Hints

1. You should have a `for` loop.
2. The first component of your `for` loop should be the string `"iterator"`.
3. The second component of your `for` loop should be the string `"condition"`.
4. The third component of your `for` loop should be the string `"iteration"`.
5. The body of your `for` loop should be empty.
