# Step 30

Change your `rows` declaration to be assigned an empty array again.

Also, change your `'Hello'` string to use double quotes again. Generally, it does not matter which of the two you prefer, but you will want to be consistent in that choice throughout your project.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. Your `rows` array should be empty.
2. Your `"Hello"` string should use double quotes.
