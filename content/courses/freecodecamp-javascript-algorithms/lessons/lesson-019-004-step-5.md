# Step 5

The <dfn>console</dfn> allows you to print and view JavaScript output. You can send information to the console using `console.log()`. For example, this code will print `"Naomi"` to the console:

```js
let developer = "Naomi";
console.log(developer);
```

The code above accesses the `developer` variable with its name in the `console.log()`. Note that the value between the parentheses is the value that will be printed.

Print the value of the `character` variable to the console. Then, click the "Console" button to view the JavaScript console.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
let character = 'Hello';

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. The `character` variable initialization should not be changed.
2. You should access the `console` in your code.
3. You should access the `log` property of the `console`.
4. You should use parentheses to call the `.log()` method.
5. You should print the `character` variable to the console.
