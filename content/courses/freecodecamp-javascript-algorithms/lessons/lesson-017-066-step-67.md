# Step 67

Following the same pattern, add a property for multiplication `*` and division `/` with the appropriate functions.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
    <title>Functional Programming Spreadsheet</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="container">
      <div></div>
    </div>
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. Your `infixToFunction` object should have a `*` property.
2. Your `*` property should be a function.
3. Your `*` function should use arrow syntax.
4. Your `*` function should have `x` as its first parameter.
5. Your `*` function should have `y` as its second parameter.
6. Your `*` function should use an implicit return.
7. Your `*` function should return the result of multiplying `x` by `y`.
8. Your `infixToFunction` object should have a `/` property.
9. Your `/` property should be a function.
10. Your `/` function should use arrow syntax.
11. Your `/` function should have `x` as its first parameter.
12. Your `/` function should have `y` as its second parameter.
13. Your `/` function should use an implicit return.
14. Your `/` function should return the result of dividing `x` by `y`.
