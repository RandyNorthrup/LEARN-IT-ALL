# Step 53

Later on in the curriculum, you will dive deeper into objects. But for now, it is time to apply what you have learned to your role playing game.

Start by deleting your `cat` object and console statement.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
    <title>RPG - Dragon Repeller</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="game">
      <div id="stats">
        <span class="stat">XP: <strong><span id="xpText">0</span></strong></span>
        <span class="stat">Health: <strong><span id="healthText">100</span></strong></span>
        <span class="stat">Gold: <strong><span id="goldText">50</span></strong></span>
      </div>
      <div id="controls">
        <button id="button1">Go to store</button>
        <button id="button2">Go to cave</button>
        <button id="button3">Fight dragon</button>
      </div>

        <span class="stat">Health: <strong><span id="monsterHealth"></span></strong></span>
      </div>
      <div id="text">
        Welcome to Dragon Repeller. You must defeat the dragon that is preventing people from leaving the town. You are in the town square. Where do you want to go? Use the buttons above.
      </div>
    </div>
