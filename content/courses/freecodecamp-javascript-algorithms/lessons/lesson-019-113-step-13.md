# Step 13

Before moving forward, you should take a moment to review the concepts you have learned.

Use the `let` keyword to declare a `profession` variable and an `age` variable. Initialize `profession` with the string `"teacher"`, but do not initialize `age` with any value.

Log both of your variables to the console to see the results.

## Starter Code

```html
let character = "Hello";
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```
