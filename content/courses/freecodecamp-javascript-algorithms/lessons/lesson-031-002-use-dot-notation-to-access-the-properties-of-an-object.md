# Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object

The last challenge created an object with various properties. Now you'll see how to access the values of those properties. Here's an example:

```js
let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);
```

Dot notation is used on the object name, `duck`, followed by the name of the property, `name`, to access the value of `Aflac`.

## Instructions

Print both properties of the `dog` object to your console.

## Starter Code

```html
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Only change code below this line
```

## Hints

1. Your code should use `console.log` to print the value for the `name` property of the `dog` object.
2. Your code should use `console.log` to print the value for the `numLegs` property of the `dog` object.

## Solution

```html
```js
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
console.log(dog.name);
console.log(dog.numLegs);
```
```
