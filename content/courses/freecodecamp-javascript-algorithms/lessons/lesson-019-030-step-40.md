# Step 40

Add a log statement to print the value of `result`. Depending on which console you use, you may not see anything printed.

## Starter Code

```html
const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(i);
}

let result = ""

## Hints

1. You should add a `console.log` call.
2. You should log your `result` variable.
