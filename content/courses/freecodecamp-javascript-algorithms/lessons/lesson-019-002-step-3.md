# Step 3

Your `character` variable currently does not have a value. You can assign a value using the <dfn>assignment</dfn> operator `=`. For example:

```js
let hello = "Hello";
```

Assigning a value to a variable at the moment of its declaration is known as <dfn>initialization</dfn>.

Initialize your `character` variable by assigning it the value `"Hello"` during its declaration.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
let character;
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should use the assignment operator `=`.
2. You should use the string `"Hello"`.
3. You should use double quotes for your `"Hello"` string.
4. You should assign `"Hello"` to your `character` variable.
