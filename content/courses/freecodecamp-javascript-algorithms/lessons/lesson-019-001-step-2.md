# Step 2

One of the most important concepts in programming is variables. A <dfn>variable</dfn> points to a specific memory address that stores a value. Variables are given a name which can be used throughout your code to access that value.

Declaring a variable means giving it a name. In JavaScript, this is often done with the `let` keyword. For example, here is how you would declare a `hello` variable:

```js
let hello;
```

Variable naming follows specific rules: names can include letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores, but cannot contain spaces and must not begin with a number.

Use the `let` keyword to declare a variable called `character`.

_Note_: It is common practice to end statements in JavaScript with a semicolon. `;`

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should use `let` in your code.
2. You should use `character` in your code.
3. You should use `let` to declare a `character` variable.
4. Your declaration should end with a semicolon.
