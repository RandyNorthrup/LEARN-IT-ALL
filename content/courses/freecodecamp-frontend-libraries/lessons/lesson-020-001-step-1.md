# Step 1

In this workshop you will create an Emoji Reactor App. The HTML boilerplate and all of the CSS has been provided for you.

Start by creating a `main` element.

Inside the `main` element create an `h1` element with a `class` of `title` and a text of `How are you feeling today?`.

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Emoji Reactor</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
</head>
<body>
--fcc-editable-region--
  
--fcc-editable-region--
</body>
</html>
```

## Hints

1. You should have a `main` element.
2. You should have a `h1` as child of `main`.
3. The `h1` element should have a class of `title`.
4. The `h1` element should contain the text `How are you feeling today?`.
