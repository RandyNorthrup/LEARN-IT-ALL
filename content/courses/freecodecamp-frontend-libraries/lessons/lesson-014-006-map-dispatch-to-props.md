# Map Dispatch to Props

The `mapDispatchToProps()` function is used to provide specific action creators to your React components so they can dispatch actions against the Redux store. It's similar in structure to the `mapStateToProps()` function you wrote in the last challenge. It returns an object that maps dispatch actions to property names, which become component `props`. However, instead of returning a piece of `state`, each property returns a function that calls `dispatch` with an action creator and any relevant action data. You have access to this `dispatch` because it's passed in to `mapDispatchToProps()` as a parameter when you define the function, just like you passed `state` to `mapStateToProps()`. Behind the scenes, React Redux is using Redux's `store.dispatch()` to conduct these dispatches with `mapDispatchToProps()`. This is similar to how it uses `store.subscribe()` for components that are mapped to `state`.

For example, you have a `loginUser()` action creator that takes a `username` as an action payload. The object returned from `mapDispatchToProps()` for this action creator would look something like:

```jsx
{
  submitLoginUser: function(username) {
    dispatch(loginUser(username));
  }
}
```

## Instructions

The code editor provides an action creator called `addMessage()`. Write the function `mapDispatchToProps()` that takes `dispatch` as an argument, then returns an object. The object should have a property `submitNewMessage` set to the dispatch function, which takes a parameter for the new message to add when it dispatches `addMessage()`.

## Starter Code

```html
const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD',
    message: message
  }
};

// Change code below this line
```

## Hints

1. `addMessage` should return an object with keys `type` and `message`.
2. `mapDispatchToProps` should be a function.
3. `mapDispatchToProps` should return an object.
4. Dispatching `addMessage` with `submitNewMessage` from `mapDispatchToProps` should return a message to the dispatch function.

## Solution

```html
```jsx
const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD',
    message: message
  }
};

// Change code below this line

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    submitNewMessage: function(message) {
      dispatch(addMessage(message));
    }
  }
};
```
```
