# Write a React Component from Scratch

Now that you've learned the basics of JSX and React components, it's time to write a component on your own. React components are the core building blocks of React applications so it's important to become very familiar with writing them. Remember, a typical React component is an ES6 `class` which extends `React.Component`. It has a render method that returns HTML (from JSX) or `null`. This is the basic form of a React component. Once you understand this well, you will be prepared to start building more complex React projects.

## Instructions

Define a class `MyComponent` that extends `React.Component`. Its render method should return a `div` that contains an `h1` tag with the text: `My First React Component!` in it. Use this text exactly, the case and punctuation matter. Make sure to call the constructor for your component, too.

Render this component to the DOM using `ReactDOM.render()`. There is a `div` with `id='challenge-node'` available for you to use.

## Starter Code

```html
// Change code below this line
```

## Hints

1. There should be a React component called `MyComponent`.
2. `MyComponent` should contain an `h1` tag with text `My First React Component!` Case and punctuation matter.
3. `MyComponent` should render to the DOM.
4. `MyComponent` should have a constructor calling `super` with `props`.

## Solution

```html
```jsx
// Change code below this line
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My First React Component!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('challenge-node'));
```
```
