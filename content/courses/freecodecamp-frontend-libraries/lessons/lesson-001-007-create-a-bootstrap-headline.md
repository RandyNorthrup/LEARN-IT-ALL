# Create a Bootstrap Headline

Now let's build something from scratch to practice our HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills.

We'll build a jQuery playground, which we'll soon put to use in our jQuery challenges.

To start with, create an `h3` element, with the text `jQuery Playground`.

Color your `h3` element with the `text-primary` Bootstrap class, and center it with the `text-center` Bootstrap class.

## Hints

1. You should add an `h3` element to your page.
2. Your `h3` element should have a closing tag.
3. Your `h3` element should be colored by applying the class `text-primary`
4. Your `h3` element should be centered by applying the class `text-center`
5. Your `h3` element should have the text `jQuery Playground`.

## Solution

```html
```html
<h3 class="text-primary text-center">jQuery Playground</h3>
```
```
