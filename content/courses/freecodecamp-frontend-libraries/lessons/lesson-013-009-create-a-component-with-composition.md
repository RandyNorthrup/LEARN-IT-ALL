# Create a Component with Composition

Now we will look at how we can compose multiple React components together. Imagine you are building an app and have created three components: a `Navbar`, `Dashboard`, and `Footer`.

To compose these components together, you could create an `App` *parent* component which renders each of these three components as *children*. To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the `render` method you could write:

```jsx
return (
 <App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
 </App>
)
```

When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in `< />` like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the `App` component and the `Navbar`, `Dashboard`, and `Footer`.

## Instructions

In the code editor, there is a simple functional component called `ChildComponent` and a class component called `ParentComponent`. Compose the two together by rendering the `ChildComponent` within the `ParentComponent`. Make sure to close the `ChildComponent` tag with a forward slash.

**Note:** `ChildComponent` is defined with an ES6 arrow function because this is a very common practice when using React.

## Starter Code

```html
const ChildComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the child</p>
    </div>
  );
};

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I am the parent</h1>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }


        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Hints

1. The React component should return a single `div` element.
2. The component should return two nested elements.
3. The component should return the `ChildComponent` as its second child.

## Solution

```html
```jsx
const ChildComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the child</p>
    </div>
  );
};

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I am the parent</h1>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <ChildComponent />
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```
```
