# Step 3

You can use the built-in function `print()` to print the output of your code on the terminal.

Functions are reusable code blocks that you can call, or invoke, to run their code when you need them. To call a function, you just need to write a pair of parentheses next to its name. You will learn more about functions very soon.

For now, go to a new line and add an empty call to the `print()` function. You should not see any output yet.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
text = 'Hello World'

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should have `print()` in your code. Pay attention to place the function call at the beginning of the line.
2. Your code contains invalid syntax and/or invalid indentation.
