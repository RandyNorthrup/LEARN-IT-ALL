# Step 1

Variables are an essential part of Python and any programming language. A variable is a name that references or points to an object. You can declare a variable by writing the variable name on the left side of the assignment operator `=` and specifying the value to assign to that variable on the right side of the assignment operator:

```py
variable_name = value
```

Create a variable called `number` and assign the value `5` to your new variable.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should declare a variable called `number`. Pay attention to place the variable name at the beginning of the line.
2. You should assign the value `5` to your `number` variable.
3. Your code contains invalid syntax and/or invalid indentation.
