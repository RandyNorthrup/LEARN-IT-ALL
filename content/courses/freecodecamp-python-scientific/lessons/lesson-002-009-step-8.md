# Step 8

You can see `11` printed on the terminal because `'Hello World'` contains 11 characters.

Another useful built-in function is `type()`, which returns the data type of a variable. Modify your `print()` call to print the data type of `text`.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
text = 'Hello World'
print(len(text))
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should call the `type()` function.
2. You should pass `text` to the `type()` function by including it between the parentheses.
3. You should pass `type(text)` to the `print()` function by including it between the parentheses. Pay attention to place the function call at the beginning of the line.
4. You should not have `print(len(text))` in your code.
5. Your code contains invalid syntax and/or invalid indentation.
