# Step 7

You can access the number of characters in a string with the built-in `len()` function.

Modify your existing `print()` call by passing `len(text)` instead of `text[-1]`.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
text = 'Hello World'
print(text[-1])
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should call the `len()` function.
2. You should pass the variable `text` to the `len()` function by including it between the parentheses.
3. You should pass `len(text)` to the `print()` function by including it between the parentheses. Pay attention to place the function call at the beginning of the line.
4. You should not have `print(text[-1])` in your code.
5. Your code contains invalid syntax and/or invalid indentation.
