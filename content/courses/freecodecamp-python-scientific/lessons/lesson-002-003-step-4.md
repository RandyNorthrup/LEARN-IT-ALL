# Step 4

An *argument* is an object or an expression passed to a function — added between the opening and closing parentheses — when it is called:

```py
greet = 'Hello!'
print(greet)
```

The code in the example above would print the string `'Hello!'`, which is the value of the variable `greet` passed to `print()` as the argument.

Print your `text` variable to the screen by passing the `text` variable as the argument to the `print()` function.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
text = 'Hello World'
print()
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should pass `text` to the `print()` function by adding the name of this variable within the opening and closing parentheses. Pay attention to place the function call at the beginning of the line.
2. Your code contains invalid syntax and/or invalid indentation.
