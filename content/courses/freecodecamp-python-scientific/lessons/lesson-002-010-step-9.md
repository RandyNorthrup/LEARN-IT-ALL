# Step 9

As you can see, the output of printing `type(text)` is `<class 'str'>`, which means that your variable is a string, indicated as `str`.

Now go to a new line and create another variable called `shift` and assign the value `3` to this variable.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
text = 'Hello World'
print(type(text))
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should declare a variable called `shift`. Pay attention to place the variable name at the beginning of the line.
2. You should assign the value `3` to your `shift` variable.
3. Your code contains invalid syntax and/or invalid indentation.
