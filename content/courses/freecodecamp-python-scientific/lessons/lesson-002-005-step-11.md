# Step 11

Modify your `print(shift)` call to print the data type of your `shift` variable.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
text = 'Hello World'
print(type(text))
shift = 3
print(shift)
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should keep your existing `print(type(text))` call.
2. You should pass `shift` to the `type()` function.
3. You should pass `type(shift)` to your `print()` function. Pay attention to place the function call at the beginning of the line.
4. You should not have `print(shift)` in your code.
5. Your code contains invalid syntax and/or invalid indentation.
