# Step 2

Variables can store values of different data types. You just assigned an integer value, but if you want to represent some text, you need to assign a string. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed by single or double quotes, but you cannot start a string with a single quote and end it with a double quote or vice versa:

```py
string_1 = "I am a string"
string_2 = 'I am also a string'
string_3 = 'This is not valid"
```

Delete your `number` variable and its value. Then, declare another variable called `text` and assign the string `'Hello World'` to this variable.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
number = 5
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should not have `number = 5` in your code.
2. You should declare a variable called `text`. Pay attention to place the variable name at the beginning of the line.
3. You should assign the string `'Hello World'` to your `text` variable. Remember to use either single or double quotes to enclose the string and pay attention to the letter case.
4. Your code contains invalid syntax and/or invalid indentation.
