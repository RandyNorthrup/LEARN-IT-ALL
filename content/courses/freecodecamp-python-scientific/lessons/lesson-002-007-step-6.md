# Step 6

You can also access string characters starting from the end of the string. The last character has an index of `-1`, the second to last `-2` and so on.

Now modify your existing `print()` call to print the last character in your string.

## Starter Code

```html
--fcc-editable-region--
text = 'Hello World'
print(text[6])
--fcc-editable-region--
```

## Hints

1. You should still call the `print()` function.
2. You should pass `text[-1]` to the `print()` function by including it between the parentheses. Pay attention to place the function call at the beginning of the line.
3. Your code contains invalid syntax and/or invalid indentation.
