# Step 1

In this project, you will implement the Luhn Algorithm. This algorithm is a formula to validate a variety of identification numbers.

Start by declaring a function called `main`, this will serve as the entry point of the program. Use the `pass` keyword to avoid an error.

## Starter Code

```html
